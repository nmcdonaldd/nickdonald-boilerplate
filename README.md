# nickdonald-boilerplate

A simple package containing some of the most commonly-implemented tools in my project toolbox.

Instead of rewriting them each time for each project, I'll just plop them here and reuse them. As I learn cool new patterns, techniques, etc. that I want to use over and over again, I'll write them here. 

This also serves as a means to learn some (very basic) Swift package/API design.
